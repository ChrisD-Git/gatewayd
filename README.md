GatewayD is a cloud-native database gateway and framework for building data-driven applications. It sits in between your database(s) and your database client(s) and proxies all queries to and their responses from the database. While doing so, it supports the following features:

- Manage authentication, authorization and access
- Support multiple database backends (SQL and NoSQL)
- Manage queries, connections and clusters
- Secure and encrypt everything AMAP with different security protocols
- Observe, monitor, analyze and control traffic
- Transform queries, results, schemas and data
- Inject data into queries and results
- Deploy anywhere: on-premise, SaaS, Cloud, CI/CD and Serverless
- Cache queries and their results
- And a bunch of other things

## Architecture

The architecture of the GatewayD consists of a core part and the plugins. The core includes network and connection management components. Any other functionality in the system are served by plugins. Then there are core plugins, always shipped with each binary and community-supported plugins.

The ultimate goal is to be able to replace everything, even the core parts, with plugins. The plugin system uses the [Go plugin system over RPC](https://github.com/hashicorp/go-plugin) by HashiCorp. Thus, the core and the plugins talk over RPC.

The high-level component architecture diagram is depicted below:

## Run GatewayD for development

You can build and run gatewayd by running the following commands. You must have Go and git installed.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:gatewayd-io/gatewayd.git && cd gatewayd
‚ùØ make run
go mod tidy && go run main.go run

```

## Run tests

The server will start listening on the default 15432 port and will proxy any clients that connects to its port to a PostgreSQL server running on port 5432. While the server is running, run the following commands to test the proxy feature(s). You must have Docker and `psql` installed.

```bash
# This run a PostgreSQL server as a Docker container
docker run --rm --name postgres-test -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres -p 5432:5432 -d postgres
# This will try to connect to the PostgreSQL server via GatewayD
psql postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:15432/postgres
```

You can use `psql` as you used to do before, to query or insert data into PostgreSQL. You can remove the Docker container by stopping it:

```bash
docker stop postgres-test
```
